    <h1>Scott Turro's Digital Portfolio</h1>
    <p> I have always been a thinker. I have pondered, theorized, planned, and reflected. My strength to
        simulate a system in my mind has led me to where I am today. A well credited scholar looking to
        take my first steps into corporate America. I have a very diverse background. I have strong
        programming abilities not only from school but also the work I do on my own. I enjoy projects
        that require strong quantitative and problem-solving skills. I often brainstorm ideas on my
        whiteboard, use latex to finalize equations, and jupyter lab for testing. Iâ€™ll take on a sense
        of ownership for my projects at your company and I would enjoy seeing them grow.
    </p>
