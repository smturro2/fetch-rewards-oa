    <h1>Scott Turro's Personal Website</h1>
    <p> Dedication and a passion to work hard have been two thing I have prided myself on. I find it important that
        I balance the hard work I put into my projects with my social life. My academics take priority, but
        I believe there is true value in growing relationships and interacting with my peers. My future goals are to
        enter the world of quantitative finance and apply quantum technology to the industry.
